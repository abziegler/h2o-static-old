    <h2 id="nutshell">In a Nutshell</h2>

    <p>H2O is a website that helps law faculty make digital casebooks that are free, simple to modify, and easy to access and print. It's offered by the Harvard Law School Library, through its <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu">Library Innovation Lab</a>.</p>
    <p>All of the content on H2O is free to access and can be copied, shared and adapted pursuant to a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license</a>. H2O's software is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/h2o" target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>

    <h2 id="faculty">For Faculty & Staff</h2>

    <h3 id="faculty-accounts">Accounts</h3>
    <p>To make a casebook, you need an account. Sign up for one here: <a href="https://opencasebook.org/user-sessions/new">sign up</a>.</p>
    <p>We currently limit accounts to people with .edu email addresses. In addition, confirmed faculty are eligible for verified account status if they supply their name and institution. Casebooks published by verified faculty are publicly searchable on H2O.</p>

    <h3 id="faculty-making-casebooks">Making Casebooks</h3>
    <p>After logging in, click <span class="inline-button">Create Casebook</span> and decide whether you want to make a new casebook from scratch or search existing casebooks for one you want to clone and customize.</p>
    <p>Your casebook remains in private, "draft" mode until you publish it. In draft mode, you can add cases or other resources to your casebook. Other resources include texts you add to H2O or any external links. You also can annotate any of the cases or text resources in your casebook by eliding less important text, highlighting key passages or attaching notes and links. When your casebook is ready, publish it to the world.</p>

    <h3 id="faculty-updating-casebooks">Updating Casebooks</h3>
    <p>You can update or revise published casebooks anytime. While you're working on a revised draft, the published version of your casebook remains available to readers. When your revisions are done, you can publish the changes, and readers will have access to the revised casebook.</p>

    <h3 id="faculty-printing-casebooks">Printing Casebooks</h3>
    <p>To create a print version of your casebook, click the <span class="inline-button action plain">Export</span> button. H2O will create a Word file containing the entire contents of your casebook. Open the file in Word to make any layout, formatting or other changes before printing or saving as PDF.</p>

    <h2 id="students">For Students</h2>
    <h3 id="students-accounts">Accounts</h3>
    <p>You don't need an account to read casebooks, but you'll need one if you want to clone or export casebooks. Accounts are free: <a href="https://opencasebook.org/user-sessions/new">sign up here</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="students-reading-casebooks">Reading Casebooks</h3>
    <p>Here's an example of a casebook, for contracts: <a href="https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/25965-contracts/" target="_blank">https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/25965-contracts/</a>. Navigate through it by clicking on sections or individual cases or other resources. To find a particular casebook, either get the link from your professor or <a href="https://opencasebook.org/search" target="_blank">search H2O</a> for your professor's name or the title of the casebook.</p>
    <h3 id="students-printing-casebooks">Printing Casebooks</h3>
    <p>Many students like having a print version of their assigned casebook. To make a free print version, log in to your account, find the casebook, and use the <span class="inline-button action plain">Export</span> button to download a Word file with the contents of the casebook. Open the file in Word, make any formatting changes you like, then print it from Word.</p>
