    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome to H2O</h2>

    <h3 id="why">Why Open Casebooks?</h3>

    <p>For many years, the casebook - an annotated collection of court cases - has been a cornerstone of legal education. That remains true today, even while most casebooks are heavy, expensive and difficult to use.</p>
    <p>We believe casebooks can be much better for faculty and students. Faculty should be able to easily create or customize their own casebooks online. And their students should be able read the casebooks online or in print for little or no cost.</p>

    <h3 id="what">What is H2O?</h3>

    <p>H2O is a website that helps faculty make casebooks that are free, simple to modify, and easy to access and print. H2O is offered by the Harvard Law School Library, through its <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu">Library Innovation Lab</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="how">How Does It Work?</h3>
    <p>All of the content on H2O is free to access and can be copied, shared and adapted under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license</a>. H2O's software is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/h2o" target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>

    <h2 id="authors">For Authors</h2>

    <h3 id="faculty-accounts">Accounts</h3>
    <p>You'll need an account to make your own casebooks. <a href="https://opencasebook.org/user-sessions/new">Sign up here for free</a>.</p>
    <p>Faculty should fill out their profiles, including display name and institution, and check the "Request Professor Verification" box. Verified faculty are marked with a green checkmark, and casebooks authored by verified faculty appear in H2O search results.</p>

    <h3 id="making-casebooks">Making Casebooks</h3>
    <p>To make a casebook, click <span class="inline-button">Create Casebook</span>. You can make a new casebook from scratch or search existing casebooks for one to clone and customize.</p>
    <p>Your casebook remains in draft mode, visible only to you, until you publish it. In draft mode, you can add or remove cases or other resources like texts and external links. You also can annotate any of the cases or text resources in your casebook by eliding text, highlighting passages or attaching notes and links. When your casebook is ready, publish it to the world by clicking <span class="inline-button action plain">Publish</span>.</p>

    <h3 id="revisions">Revisions</h3>
    <p>Modify your published casebooks anytime by clicking <span class="inline-button action plain">Revise</span>. The original version of your casebook remains available to readers while you're working on revisions. When you finish your revisions, press <span class="inline-button action plain">Publish</span> to merge the revisions into the public version of the casebook.</p>

    <h3 id="faculty-exporting-printing">Export & Print</h3>
    <p>To print your casebook, click the <span class="inline-button action plain">Export</span> button. H2O will download a Word file containing the entire contents of your casebook. Open the file in Word to make any layout, formatting or other changes before printing.</p>

    <h2 id="students">For Students</h2>
    <h3 id="students-accounts">Accounts</h3>
    <p>You don't need an account to read casebooks, but you'll need one if you want to clone or export casebooks. If you want an account, <a href="https://opencasebook.org/user-sessions/new">sign up here for free</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="reading-casebooks">Reading Casebooks</h3>
    <p>To find a particular casebook, either get the link from your professor or <a href="https://opencasebook.org/search" target="_blank">search H2O</a> for your professor's name or the title of the casebook.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of a casebook, for contracts: <a href="https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/25965-contracts/" target="_blank">https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/25965-contracts/</a>. Navigate through it by clicking on sections or individual cases or other resources.</p>
    <h3 id="students-exporting-printing">Export and Print</h3>
    <p>You can print H2O casebooks or portions of casebooks. Use the <span class="inline-button action plain">Export</span> button to download a Word file with the contents of the casebook. Open the file in Word, make any formatting changes you like, then print it from Word.</p>

    <h2 id="librarians">For Librarians</h2>
    <p>H2O works best when faculty and students can turn to the trusted experts in their law libraries for questions about preparing and using casebooks.</p>
    <p>We offer specialized training and assistance for law librarians interested in helping their faculty make the most of H2O. If you'd like to learn more, please contact us at <a href="mailto: h2o@law.harvard.edu">h2o@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>
