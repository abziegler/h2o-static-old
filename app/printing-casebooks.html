    <p>H2O allows anyone to download content as a formatted Word file, which can be modified, re-styled and printed from Word. </p>

    <h2 id="exporting">Exporting Content</h2>
    <p>You can export and print a full casebook, specific casebook sections or individual resources (such as a case). Just click the Export button to the right of the content you want to download and print. </p>

        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/export.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook's contents page with the Export button highlighted.">
    </figure>
    <p>When you click the button, H2O will download a Microsoft Word file with whatever you chose to export. The download may take several seconds if you're exporting a big casebook.</p>
    <h3 id="note-about-annotations" class="toc-level-2"></h3>

    <h3 id="links">Links</h3>
    <p>Links in H2O are ... links, which means they point to content hosted elsewhere, outside of H2O</p>

    <h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>
    <p>Note that any annotations in the online version of the casebook will carry over to the Word file, although those annotations will not be interactive. For example, text that you've hidden in H2O using an elision will not be present or accessible in the Word file; instead, the Word file will display an ellipsis in the position of the hidden text.</p>






    <h2 id="working-in-word">Working in Word</h2>
    <h3 id="word-styles">Default Word Styles</h3>
    <p>The exported Word file comes with pre-assigned styles using a default style template. This makes it easier for you to customize styling in Word, such as by global changing headings, fonts, text-size and other characteristics of the text. Currently H2O offers only the default template.</p>

    <h3 id="tables-of-contents" class="toc-level-2">Tables of Contents</h3>
    <p>H2O automatically generates a table of contents for exported content. Currently, you need to insert page numbers into the document and then refresh the table of contents for page numbering to appear in the table of contents.</p>
