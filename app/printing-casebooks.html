    <p>H2O allows anyone to download content as a formatted Word file, which can be modified, re-styled and printed from Word. </p>

    <h2 id="exporting">Exporting Content</h2>
    <p>You can export and print a full casebook, specific casebook sections or individual resources (such as a case). Just click the Export button to the right of the content you want to download and print. </p>

    </figure>
    <p>When you click the button, H2O will download a Microsoft Word file with whatever you chose to export. The download may take several seconds if you're exporting a big casebook.</p>
    <h3 id="note-about-annotations" class="toc-level-2"></h3>

    <h3 id="links">Links</h3>
    <p>Because links point to content hosted outside of H2O, your export file will not contain the content of the linked page. Instead, only the URL of the linked page will appear in the exported file:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/link.png" alt="A screenshot of a page from a downloaded casebook showing that the file displays only the URL of the link, not the content of the linked page.">
    </figure>
    <p>If you want to include the external content in the print version of the casebook, you can add it directly to the Word file or you can create a text resource in the casebook within H2O, and then paste in the given content. As always, please make sure any use like this is permitted by applicable copyright and license requirements.</p>
    <h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>
    <p>Annotations in the online version of the casebook will carry over to the Word file, although those annotations will not be interactive. For example, text that you've hidden in H2O using an elision will not be present or accessible in the Word file; instead, the Word file will display an ellipsis in the position of the hidden text.</p>

    <h2 id="working-in-word">Working in Word</h2>
    <h3 id="word-styles">Default Word Styles</h3>
    <p>The exported Word file comes with pre-assigned styles using a default style template. This makes it easier for you to customize styling in Word, such as by global changing headings, fonts, text-size and other characteristics of the text. Currently H2O offers only the default template.</p>

    <h3 id="tables-of-contents" class="toc-level-2">Tables of Contents</h3>
    <p>H2O automatically generates a table of contents for exported content. Currently, you need to insert page numbers into the document and then refresh the table of contents for page numbering to appear in the table of contents.</p>
