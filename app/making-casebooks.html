    </figure>

    <h3 id="from-scratch">Building from Scratch</h3>
    <p>Building a new casebook from scratch is easy. There are many different ways to do it, but here's a method we like and recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Add a title.</li>
        <li>2. Add the sections and sub-sections that form the basic structure of your casebook.</li>
        <li>3. Add the resources (cases, texts, links) you want to each section.</li>
        <li>4. Annotate individual resources using elisions, highlights, links and notes.</li>
        <li>5. Publish your casebook</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read on below to learn more about each of these steps.</p>

    <h3 id="adapting-casebooks">Adapting Existing Casebooks</h3>
    <p>To adapt an existing casebook, search our database of casebooks for the one you want to use as a starting point. You can search by keyword (like "Torts" or by author (like "Zittrain"). </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/search-results.png" alt="A screenshot of the search page.">
    </figure>
    <p>Select the casebook you want to adapt, then click the "Clone" button to create your own draft version of the casebook.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/clone-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, with the 'Clone' button highlighted.">
    </figure>
    <p>Once you've cloned the casebook to create your own draft version, you can make changes by adding or deleting sections or resources, and by making your own annotations.</p>

    <h2 id="titles">Titles</h2>
    <p>You can edit the title of your casebook and add a subtitle and headnotes by clicking on "Casebook" tab.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/adding-titles.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
    <p>Sections form the structure of your casebook. To add a section, click the "Add Section" action button, and then fill in the section title, as well as any section subtitle or headnotes. Click "Save" when you're finished updating the title, subtitle and headnotes. The Section will appear initially at the bottom of your casebook contents, but you can move a section by clicking, dragging and dropping it into the desired location. </p>

    <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
    <p>Resources form the content of your casebook. To add a resource to your casebook, click the "Add Resource" action button.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-resource-button.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form, with the add resource action button highlighted">
    </figure>

    <p>Then select the type of resource you want to add. H2O currently supports three resource types: (1) Cases; (2) Texts; and (3) Links.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-resource.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form, with the add resource form activated.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-cases">Cases</h3>
    <p>Cases are opinions issued by courts. H2O supplies them. You can search our database for the citation of the one you want. When you click the case within the search results, H2O will add it to your casebook. If the case you want is not appearing in search results, let us know and we'll add it to the database. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-case.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the find case tab active, and a citation entered with results showing.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-texts">Texts</h3>
    <p>Texts are resources created by users. Often these are introductory or explanatory notes prepared by the author to offer context about a case. They also can include questions, problem sets, statutory references or any other content the author adds. To add a text, simple use the text editor form to include and style your content.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the create text tab active, and some sample text entered.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-links">Links</h3>
    <p>Links are resources that point to materials hosted elsewhere on the web. These can be websites, government reports, articles, blogposts, etc. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-link.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the add link tab active, and an example URL entered.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="annotating-resources">Annotating Resources</h2>
    <p>Once you've added a case or text resource to your casebook, you can make several different types of annotations, including eliding text, replacing text, higlighting text, adding comments to selected text and adding links to selected text. This part of the guide walks you through each type of annotation.</p>

    <h3 id="elisions">Elisions</h3>
    <p>Authors often want to hide text that is not essential to the casebook, such as portions of cases that discuss unrelated issues or factual or procedural background. With H2O, authors can use elisions to hide any unnecessary text. Here is an example of an elision: </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elided-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case from which some text has been elided.">
    </figure>

    <p>H2O hides the text but readers can view the hidden text by simply clicking on the ellipsis.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/view-hidden-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case revealing the previously hidden text.">
    </figure>

    To make an elision, select the desired text, then use the annotation menu that pops up in the right margin to choose the "Elision."

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elide-menu.png" alt="A screenshot of a case with text selected for elision and the annotation menu with the elide option highlighted.">
    </figure>

    <p>H2O then will hide that text, marking the elision with an ellipsis.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elision-complete.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the successful elision of certain text.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove the elision, click the edit icon in the right margin and select "Remove elision." </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/remove-elision.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to remove elisions.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="replacement-text">Replacing Text</h3>
    <p>To maintain readability, authors often want to replace elided text with their replacement text that paraphrases the hidden content or supplies needed transition words. H2O supports this through annotations that allow authors to supply replacement text for elided passages. </p>
    <p>To use this type of annotation, simply select the text you want to hide and then choose "Replace" from the annotation menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/replace-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to add replacement text in place of a hidden text passage.">
    </figure>

    <p>You'll then be prompted to type your replacement text into a form, and to click save when finished:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/enter-replacement-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to add replacement text in place of a hidden text passage.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove the elision or replacement text, click the edit icon in the right margin and use the menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/remove-replacement-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to remove replacement text or restore the original text.">
    </figure>


    <h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
    <p>Highlights work just as you would expect. Select the desired text, pick "Highlight" from the annotation menu, and H2O will apply a yellow background color to the selected text. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/highlight-menu.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to highlight text.">
    </figure>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/highlighted-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing an example of highlighted text.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove highlighting, click the edit icon in the right margin and select "Remove highlighting."</p>

    <h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
    <p>H2O allows authors to attach notes to selected passages in any case or text resource. To add a comment, as with other annotations, select the desired text, then pick "Add note" from the annotation menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-note.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to attach notes to text.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="links">Links</h3>
    <p>H2O allows authors to attach external links to selected passages in any case or text resource. To add a link, select the desired text, then pick "Add link" from the annotation menu and enter the URL.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-link-annotation.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to attach links to text.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="publishing-casebooks">Publishing a Casebook</h2>
    <p>While you're working on your casebook, it remains in "Draft" mode, indicated by the yellow banner at the top of the page and by the draft label on your dashboard.</p>
    <p>When you're ready to share the book publicly, click the "Publish" button visible to the right of the contents.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/publish-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook's contents page showing the Publish button on the right side of the page.">
    </figure>
    <p>Once a casebook is published, it's freely accessible to everyone online, and it can be copied, modified and adapted by any accountholders. In addition, if you're a verified author, your published casebook will appear in search results on H2O.</p>


    <h2 id="revising-casebooks">Revising a Casebook</h2>
    <p>H2O enables authors to revise published casebooks at any time. While you're working on a revised draft, your original published casebook remains publicly available. When you're done making changes, you can publish your revised casebook, and it will replace the prior version.</p>

    <h3 id="making-changes">Making Changes</h3>
    <p>To revise a casebook, click the "Revise" button to the right of the casebook contents:</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/revise-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a published casebook's contents page showing the Revise button on the right side of the page.">
    </figure>

    <p>H2O will create a draft version of the published casebook, which you can modify however you like. Until you publish the revised version of your casebook, your working draft will appear in your dashboard as a yellow banner over the blue, published casebook. Click the yellow banner to access the draft, and click the blue part of the casebook image to access the published version.

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dashboard-revised.png" alt="A screenshot of a dashboard showing a published casebook, a draft casebook, and a published casebook with a draft revision.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="publishing-changes">Publishing Changes</h3>
    <p>When you're done making changes, click the "Publish" button, and H2O will substitute the new, revised version of your casebook for the prior version.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/publish-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a dashboard showing a draft revision of a casebook with the Publish button highlighted.">
    </figure>

    <p>Please note that H2O currently does not maintain copies of prior versions of casebooks. If you want to ensure that an existing version is not replaced, then you should clone the published casebook and create a new casebook rather than revise the existing casebook.</p>
