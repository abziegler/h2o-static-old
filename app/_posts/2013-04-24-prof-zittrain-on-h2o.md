title: "Prof. Zittrain on H2O [Video]"
---

The H2O Project has received generous support from the [Harvard Initiative for Teaching & Learning (HILT)](https://hilt.harvard.edu/) and the [Harvard Library Lab](http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/projects/h20-adaptable-digital-textbooks). The great folks at HILT helped to prepare a video in which [Professor Jonathan Zittrain](http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=106), H2O’s PI, discusses some of the Project’s objectives and some of the ideas underlying it.
