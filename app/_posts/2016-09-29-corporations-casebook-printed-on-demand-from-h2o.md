title: "Corporations Casebook - Printed on Demand from H2O"
---

This summer, in conjunction with Professor Spamann’s staff (as well as Berkman-Klein intern Kate Mays), the H2O team exported Prof. Spamann’s [Corporations Playlist](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/79342-corporations) rom H2O and undertook the legwork necessary to insert it into a design program and format it for print-on-demand.
