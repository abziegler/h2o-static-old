title: "H2O Faculty User Profile: Brian JM Quinn"
---

 Boston College Associate Professor [Brian Quinn](https://perma.cc/S9RQ-RYSC) has been an H2O user since 2013. He has used H2O to teach his Corporations course for the past two years, but this year he took the Corporations playlist he created in H2O and published it in book form on Amazon and CreateSpace.

Three-fourths of his class purchased this casebook at a price of $30 each. The book sales produced a royalty of $10.17 a book, all of which professor Quinn has directed toward Boston College’s [Public Interest Law](http://www.bcpilf.org/) Fund.

The H2O team is currently working on tools to make export and print easier for both faculty and student users, so other users can similarly easily export their work to print-on-demand.
