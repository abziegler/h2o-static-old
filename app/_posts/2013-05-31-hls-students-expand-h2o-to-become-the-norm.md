title: "HLS Students: Expand H2O to Become the Norm"
---

Last month, we were thrilled that H2O received a mention in a Bloomberg article by HLS students Raja Bobbili and Daniel Doktori titled [“Harvard Law School Can Learn from MOOCs.”](https://perma.cc/5DUU-4JU7)  After noting that the H2O initiative “has reinvented the legal textbook by creating an open-source platform that allows students and professors to read collaboratively, sharing questions, edits and annotations,” Bobbili and Doktori conclude that “this effort should expand to become the norm.”

While continuing to develop free digital casebooks with HLS professors, our team is also working with professors from a growing list of law schools across the country. If you’re interested — as a teacher, students, librarian, or academic technologist — in helping H2O expand to become the norm, please let us know!
