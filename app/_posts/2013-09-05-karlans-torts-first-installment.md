title: "Karlan's Torts - First Installment"
---

We’re very excited indeed to note that [Professor Pam Karlan](https://perma.cc/K9JF-R22L) of Stanford Law School has made the first installment of her Fall 2013 Torts class materials on H2O; those materials are available at  [https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/17378-karlan-torts-materials-part-i/](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/17378-karlan-torts-materials-part-i/).
 
Professor Karlan has added and selected an array of edited cases (some adapted from edits by other H2O users, such as Professor Jonathan Zittrain, and others she edited from scratch). Professor Karlan has also added many new introductions, and has included numerous links to videos and other external sources (see, for instance, her collection of materials for “[An Introduction to Torts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/17378-karlan-torts-materials-part-i/sections/1-an-introduction-to-torts)."
