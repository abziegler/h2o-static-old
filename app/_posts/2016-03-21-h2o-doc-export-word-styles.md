title: "H2O Doc Export - Word Styles"
---

When an H2O playlist or item is exported as a Word document, the exported .doc file comes with “Word styles” already added to the document for use. (A style is a set of formatting characteristics, such as font name, size, color, paragraph alignment and spacing.)

Through the use of Word styles, you can quickly and easily apply a set of formatting choices consistently throughout your document. H2O’s .doc exports include styles that already correspond to areas in the document, ex. “Item description,” “Playlist title,” “Annotated text” etc.

By right-clicking on a specific style in the Word header, you can modify that style (for example, by changing text color to red), and that change will apply to all text that falls within that style: 

Note: Word styles are applied to the document upon export, based off the HTML tags of the particular items- cases, text blocks – within it. Not all items in H2O have identical HTML, meaning that while Word styles will successfully apply to the majority of items in an export, there may be some outliers that must be manually changed to reflect what’s changed when a Word style is modified.
